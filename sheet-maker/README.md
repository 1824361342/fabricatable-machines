# Sheet maker

A pressing rig for making sheet material from waste. First tests are with PLA (bio plastic) and wood waste from CNC milling. Designed to be fabricatable on a large format CNC mill. We use a ShopBot PRS alpha to fabricated the parts.

## Status

Currently testing first mold box. Heating is done one cooking plate. Watercooling by submerging box mold and hydraulic press in a bucket of water. Results are promising, but twosided heat source is needed.

## Core principles

## TODO

Preparation for Oslo Innovation Week Hackathon 2016

## Roadmap

-Test top side heating with 220v cartridge heater.
-Develop water cooling system by engraving aluimium plates.
-Develop heat and pressure monitoring
-Testing vacuum clamping/bagging to replace hydraulic pressing. Much cheaper to scale if it works.
-Make new mold for lasercutter sized sheets
-Develop a s system for automating the sheet pressing
-Make a full size (2.5m x 1.25m) mold
