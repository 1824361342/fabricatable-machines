# Milling the valchromat parts for the table

_"A torsion box consists of two thin layers of material (skins) on either side of a lightweight core, usually a grid of beams."_

[Torsion boxes on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torsion_box)

The purpose of the tosion box is to make a stiff bed for the CNC machine to travel and operate on while keeping the parts easy to transport.

## General

* The parts are modelled with dogbones for a 6mm bit.
* Additonal holddown screw-holes can and should be be added, also inside parts where needed.

## 12 mm sheets

The 3mm wide slots are 9 mm deep

* Sheet 1: 12 mm torsion box parts 1

### Production notes v3
* One 12 mm short rib was missing in the cutsheet
* Screw holes should be moved so that feet attach better
* Screws on top of feet should be countersunk so that they do not protrude during assembly.
* Include diagonal stiffeners

## 8 mm sheets

The 3mm wide slots are 6.5 mm deep

The pockets on the top edges is 4mm deep in both cases.

* Sheet 1: 8 mm torsion box parts 1. 12.5 mm pockets are 3.5mm deep.

## 19 mm sheet

The pockets on both long edges are 9 mm deep.

* Sheet 1: 19mm spoilboard with pre-drilled holes and ledges on the sides
