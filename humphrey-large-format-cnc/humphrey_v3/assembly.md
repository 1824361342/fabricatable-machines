## Summary

These are instructions for how to assemble Humphrey v3 from a kit of pre-produced parts. Each section list the parts you will need to complete the stage. Please contribute by offering improvements to these instructions, either by commenting in the Issues or as a Pull-request.
## Introduction to the parts
First you will build the table which you then can use as a work-table to assemble all the other parts on. You will then build the mechanics and tune the motion system before finally adding the motors and electronics.

# The table

This section tells you how to build the table. It is recommended to start with this since you then can use it as a work-table to assemble all the other parts on. 

The table consist of a [torison box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torsion_box) that rests on 6 legs with adjustable feet. On top of the torsion box there is a 19 mm thick spoil board sheet that is the size of the work area of the machine. This layer will be worn down when using the machine and will have to be re-planed every now and then and eventually it will have to be made thicker again by glueing on more sheets.

Equipment:
* Wood glue for 2,5 m^2
* 28 of Ø4x40mm wood screws for the spoil board
* 4 of Ø6mm wooden dowels for the spoil board
* 12 of Ø6mm wooden dowels for aligning the feet
* 130 of Ø5x50mm wood screws for the torsion box
* 24 of Ø4x40 wood screws for attaching the legs
* Ø5x50mm wood screws for the legs
* 44 of M5x35mm machine screws for the Y-rail
* Electric screwdriver with LOW torque setting
* It is also very recommended but not mandatory to have a [foam glue-roller](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Portable-Handheld-Glue-Applicator-with-2pcs-Rollers-Manual-Gluer-for-Woodworking-Glue-Machine-180ml-320ml-Hot/32839266171.html) as you will have use of it every time you need to add new thickness to your spoil-board.
* Whrench for M8 nut to adjust the feet
* [Laser level](https://www.clasohlson.com/no/Bosch-Quigo-III-krysslaser-/41-1002)

Summary of the steps:
1. Build the legs
2. Build the torsion box on the legs
3. Attach the Y-rails
4. Attach the spoil board

## The legs

![Leg assembled](https://github.com/fellesverkstedet/fabricatable-machines/raw/master/humphrey-large-format-cnc/humphrey_v3/img/assembly/leg.JPG)

_One assembled leg with adjustable foot_

### Building the legs

There are 6 identical legs that carry the torsion box. Each will have an adjustable foot underneath. 
* Find 6 set of the valcrhomat leg pieces

![Pieces](https://github.com/fellesverkstedet/fabricatable-machines/raw/master/humphrey-large-format-cnc/humphrey_v3/img/assembly/foot_pieces.JPG)

* Dry fit a foot to understand how they go together
* Dissasemble it
* Apply glue to the surfaces that will be pressed together.
* Assemble the leg and clamp the pieces in place using the 5x50mm wood screws. USE THE LOWEST SETTING ON A ELECTRIC SCREW DRIVER and finish them with a hand tool. The purpose of the scews is just to clamp the pieces together while the glue sets.
* The rubber feet will be attached later.

## The Torsion box

The torsion box is build from glued together valchromat and consists of two "skins" separated by a core. The skins are divided in two pieces each. The top skin is 12 mm thick and the bottom one is 8 mm thick. The core consists of both 8 mm and 12 mm thick pieces that slot together. 

### Placement of the machine

* Figure out where you want to place the machine and on which side you will control it from. (It will be possible to move it after assembly but before is much easier.) You want to be able to walk around the long sides and at least the front of the short side of the machine without risk of becoming trapped between the moving gantry and the walls or other obstacles.

![Size](https://github.com/fellesverkstedet/fabricatable-machines/raw/master/humphrey-large-format-cnc/humphrey_v3/img/assembly/size.JPG)

### Building the torsion box

* Find the 8 mm thick valchromat "bottom skin" pieces. Note that on one side the holes are placed 100mm further in, this is the operator side. Place this side towards were you will be standing when operating the machine.

![Size](https://github.com/fellesverkstedet/fabricatable-machines/raw/master/humphrey-large-format-cnc/humphrey_v3/img/assembly/8mm_skins.JPG)

* Align the legs under the bottom torsion box skins (8 mm thick) using 6mm diameter wooden dowels. There are 12 predrilled holes.

![Table](https://github.com/fellesverkstedet/fabricatable-machines/raw/master/humphrey-large-format-cnc/humphrey_v3/img/assembly/table_first_skin.JPG)

* Screw the legs into place. Place the screws from below so that you can access them later. Do not glue the legs to the table. (You might want to exchange them with a [storage system](https://github.com/fellesverkstedet/hat-systems) later).
* Place an adjustable rubber foot on the bottom of each leg with a large M8 washer above the nut and set it to middle position. Try to set all feet to the same height.

![foot](https://github.com/fellesverkstedet/fabricatable-machines/raw/master/humphrey-large-format-cnc/humphrey_v3/img/assembly/foot.JPG)

* Use a [Laser level](https://www.clasohlson.com/no/Bosch-Quigo-III-krysslaser-/41-1002) and adjust the nut on the rubber feet so that the table is level.
* Find the core pieces

![Ribs](https://github.com/fellesverkstedet/fabricatable-machines/raw/master/humphrey-large-format-cnc/humphrey_v3/img/assembly/ribs.jpg)

* Dry mount a few torsion box core pieces so that you are fammiliar with how they fit together before you apply glue to them.
 The long core pieces go on first
* The short core pices slot into the long ones
* Check the "open time" on your brand of wood glue so you know how long time you have to work with. Prepare some paper for spills etc.
* When you are familiar with how they fit together, apply glue to the lower edges that will rest on top of the lower skin. Do not yet apply glue to the edges facing up.
* Screw the core pieces to the bottom skin from below, using Ø5x50mm wood screws. USE THE LOWEST SETTING ON A ELECTRIC SCREW DRIVER and finish them with a hand tool. The purpose of the scews is just to clamp the pieces together while the glue sets. These bottom screws can be removed later but can also stay in. Your choice.

![Table](https://github.com/fellesverkstedet/fabricatable-machines/raw/master/humphrey-large-format-cnc/humphrey_v3/img/assembly/table_core.JPG)

* Find the two 12 mm valchromat top skin sheets

![Size](https://github.com/fellesverkstedet/fabricatable-machines/raw/master/humphrey-large-format-cnc/humphrey_v3/img/assembly/12mm_skins.JPG)

* Dry mount the top skin sheets (12mm thick) as practice before adding glue, you can use the tip of a flat screwdriver to help get the "fingers" top pop into the holes in the skin. 
* Take the top skin off and smear glue on the edges of the core that will touch the bottom of the top skin.
* Put the top skin back on and screw it from the top using Ø5x50mm wood screws. USE THE LOWEST SETTING ON A ELECTRIC SCREW DRIVER and finish them with a hand tool. The purpose of the scews is just to clamp the pieces together while the glue sets. These top screws will have to be removed after the glue has set and before the spoilboard is glued on. 
* Make a note of the time so that you will know when the screws are safe to remove. Check the glue bottle for the required clamping time.

## The Y-rails

* Find all long and thin aluminium pieces

![y-rail and nut](https://github.com/fellesverkstedet/fabricatable-machines/raw/master/humphrey-large-format-cnc/humphrey_v3/img/assembly/thin_alu.jpg)

* Find the 12 mm thick valchromat spacer pieces

![Spacers](https://github.com/fellesverkstedet/fabricatable-machines/raw/master/humphrey-large-format-cnc/humphrey_v3/img/assembly/12mm_spacers.jpg)

* Find the small aluminium links

![Links](https://github.com/fellesverkstedet/fabricatable-machines/raw/master/humphrey-large-format-cnc/humphrey_v3/img/assembly/links.jpg)

* Note that rounded corners always should point outward.

* Place the aluminium "mega nuts" on the top long sides of the torsion and the valchromat spacers and aluminium rails under the sides and screw them together from below with M5x35mm machine screws and large washers. Do not tighten the screws yet.

![y_rails](https://github.com/fellesverkstedet/fabricatable-machines/raw/master/humphrey-large-format-cnc/humphrey_v3/img/assembly/y-rail_mount.jpg)

![y_rails](https://github.com/fellesverkstedet/fabricatable-machines/raw/master/humphrey-large-format-cnc/humphrey_v3/img/assembly/y-rail2.jpg)

![y_rails](https://github.com/fellesverkstedet/fabricatable-machines/raw/master/humphrey-large-format-cnc/humphrey_v3/img/assembly/y-rail3.jpg)

* Place the links into the Y-rails from below and screw them in place, don't use washers. Press the rails towards each other before tightening the link screws. Leave the rest of the screws loose but in place.

## The Spoil board

* Find the 19 mm Valchromat spoilboard.

![Spoilboard](https://github.com/fellesverkstedet/fabricatable-machines/raw/master/humphrey-large-format-cnc/humphrey_v3/img/assembly/spoilboard.jpg)

* Find something that you can smear wood glue onto a 3m^2 wide area quickly with. A [foam glue-roller](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Portable-Handheld-Glue-Applicator-with-2pcs-Rollers-Manual-Gluer-for-Woodworking-Glue-Machine-180ml-320ml-Hot/32839266171.html) is recommended.  
* Preapre an electric screw drivers, Ø4x40mm wood screws and matching bits.
* Make sure the torsion box wood glue has dried enough to remove the clamping screws from the top skin. 
* Remove all the 5x50mm screws from the top of the torsion box. ()You may remove the ones from the bottom as well but it is not required.)
* Find the four Ø6mm plug holes where the corners of the spoil board will go and put wooden dowels in the holes. 

![dowel_holes_spoilboard](https://github.com/fellesverkstedet/fabricatable-machines/raw/master/humphrey-large-format-cnc/humphrey_v3/img/assembly/dowel_holes_spoilboard.jpg)

* Apply layer of wood glue to the table 40 mm past the wooden dowels and 10 mm away from the aluminium "mega nuts" on the sides. 
* Smear it out to an even thickness.
* Place the spoilboard on the wooden dowels.
* Screw down the spoilboard down using 28 Ø4x40mm wood screws. Count them.
* Mark the time so you will know when the glue has set.
* Remove the 28 Ø4x40mm wood screws from the spoil board when the glue has set. Count them to not miss any.
