﻿These are instructions for how to assemble Humphrey v3 from a kit of pre-produced parts. Each section list the parts you will need to complete the stage. Please contribute by offering improvements to these instructions, either by commenting in the Issues or as a Pull-request.
# Introduction to the parts
First you will build the table which you then can use as a work-table to assemble all the other parts on. You will then build the mechanics and tune the motion system before finally adding the motors and electronics.

# The table
This section tells you how to build the table. It is recommended to start with this since you then can use it as a work-table to assemble all the other parts on.

Equipment:
* Wood glue for 2,5 m^2
* 28 of Ø4x40mm wood screws for the spoil board
* 4 of Ø6mm wooden dowels for the spoil board
* 12 of Ø6mm wooden dowels for aligning the feet
* 130 of Ø5x50mm wood screws for the torsion box
* 24 of Ø4x40 wood screws for attaching the legs
* ?? of Ø5x50mm wood screws for the legs
* 44 of M5x35mm machine screws for the Y-rail
* Electric screwdriver with LOW torque setting
* It is also very recommended but not mandatory to have a [foam glue-roller](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Portable-Handheld-Glue-Applicator-with-2pcs-Rollers-Manual-Gluer-for-Woodworking-Glue-Machine-180ml-320ml-Hot/32839266171.html) as you will have use of it every time you need to add new thickness to your spoil-board.
* Whrench for M8 nut to adjust the feet
* [Laser level](https://www.clasohlson.com/no/Bosch-Quigo-III-krysslaser-/41-1002)

Summary of the steps:
1. Build the legs
2. Build the torsion box on the legs
3. Attach the Y-rails
4. Attach the spoil board

# The Table

The table consist of a [torison box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torsion_box) that rests on 6 legs with adjustable feet. On top of the torsion box there is a 19 mm thick spoil board sheet that is the size of the work area of the machine. This layer will be worn down when using the machine and will have to be re-planed every now and then and eventually it will have to be made thicker again by glueing on more sheets.

## Building the legs
![Leg](https://github.com/fellesverkstedet/fabricatable-machines/raw/master/humphrey-large-format-cnc/humphrey_v3/img/assembly/leg.JPG)

_One assembled leg with adjustable foot_

There are 6 identical legs that carry the torsion box. Each has an adjustable foot underneath. 
* Dry fit a foot to understand how they go together
* Dissasemble it
* Apply glue to the surfaces that will touch
* Assemble the leg and clamp the pieces in place using the 5x50mm wood screws. USE THE LOWEST SETTING ON A ELECTRIC SCREW DRIVER and finish them with a hand tool. The purpose of the scews is just to clamp the pieces together while the glue sets.
* Place the adjustable foot in the bottom and set it to middle position.

## The Torsion box

The torsion box consists of two "skins" separated by a core. The skins are divided in to two pieces each. The top skin is 12 mm thick and the bottom one is 8 mm thick. The core consists of both 8 mm and 12 mm thick pieces that slot together. 

### Placement of the machine

Figure out where you want to place the machine and assemble it there. Think about how you want it oriented. You want to be able to walk around the long sides and at least the front of the short side of the machine without risk of becoming trapped between the moving gantry and the walls or other obstacles.

### Building the box on the legs

* Align the legs under the bottom torsion box skins (8 mm thick) using wooden dowels

![Table](https://github.com/fellesverkstedet/fabricatable-machines/raw/master/humphrey-large-format-cnc/humphrey_v3/img/assembly/table_first_skin.JPG)

* Screw the legs into place from below. Do not glue them to the table if you want to be able to change them with a [storage system](https://github.com/fellesverkstedet/hat-systems) later
* Use the [Laser level](https://www.clasohlson.com/no/Bosch-Quigo-III-krysslaser-/41-1002) and adjust the feet so that the table is level
* Dry mount a few torsion box core pieces so that you are fammiliar with how they fit together before you apply glue to them.
* Add the long torsion box core pieces, apply glue to the edges of them that touch the lower skin. Clamp them in with Ø5x50mm wood screws from below the table. USE THE LOWEST SETTING ON A ELECTRIC SCREW DRIVER and finish them with a hand tool. The purpose of the scews is just to clamp the pieces together while the glue sets.
* Apply the shorter torsion box core pieces, glue and screw them in the same way as the long ones.

![Table](https://github.com/fellesverkstedet/fabricatable-machines/raw/master/humphrey-large-format-cnc/humphrey_v3/img/assembly/table_core.JPG)

* Dry mount the top skin sheets (12mm thick) as practice before adding glue, you can use the tip of a flat screwdriver to help get the "fingers" top pop into the holes in the skin. 
* Take the top skin off and smear glue on the edges that will touch the bottom of the top skin

## The Y-rails
* Place the aluminium "mega nuts" on the top long sides of the torsion box
* Place the valchromat spacers and aluminium rails under the sides and secure them with M5x35mm machine screws. Do not tighten the screws yet.

## The Spoil board
* Make sure the torsion box wood glue has dried enough to remove the clamping screws from the top skin.
* Remove all the 5x50mm screws from the top of the torsion box.
* Find the four Ø6mm plug holes where the corners of the spoil board will go and put wooden dowels in the holes. 
* Apply glue to the bottom of the spoilboard
* Place the spoilboard on the wooden dowels
* Screw down the spoilboard using 28 of Ø4x40mm wood screws
* Remove the 28 Ø4x40mm wood screws from the spoil board when the glue has set. Count them to not miss any.
