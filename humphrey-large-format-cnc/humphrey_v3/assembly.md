﻿These are instructions for how to assemble Humphrey v3 from a kit of pre-produced parts. First you will build the table which you then can use as a work-table to assemble all the other parts on. You will then build the mechanics and tune the motion system before finally adding the motors and electronics.

# Table
This section tells you how to build the table. It is recommended to start with this since you then can use it as a work-table to assemble all the other parts on.

Equipment:
* Wood glue for 2,5 m^2
* 28 of Ø4x40mm wood screws for the spoil board
* 4 of Ø6 mm wooden dowels for the spoil board
* 130 of Ø5x50mm wood screws for the torsion box
* ?? of Ø5x50mm wood screws for the legs
* 44 of M5x35mm machine screws for the Y-rail
* Electric screwdriver with LOW torque setting
* It is also very recommended but not mandatory to have a [foam glue-roller](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Portable-Handheld-Glue-Applicator-with-2pcs-Rollers-Manual-Gluer-for-Woodworking-Glue-Machine-180ml-320ml-Hot/32839266171.html) as you will have use of it every time you need to add new thickness to your spoil-board.
* Whrench for M8 nut to adjust the feet
* [Laser level](https://www.clasohlson.com/no/Bosch-Quigo-III-krysslaser-/41-1002)

Summary of the steps:
1. Build the legs
2. Build the torsion box on the legs
3. Attach the Y-rails
4. Attach the spoil board

## Legs
There are 6 identical legs that carry the torsion box. Each has an adjustable foot underneath. 
* Dry fit a foot to understand how they go together
* Dissasemble it
* Apply glue to the surfaces that will touch
* Assemble the leg and clamp the pieces in place using the 5x50mm wood screws
* Place the adjustable foot in the bottom and set it to middle position.

## Torsion box
## Y-rails
* Place the aluminium "mega nuts" on the top long sides of the torsion box
* Place the valchromat spacers and aluminium rails under the sides and secure them with M5x35mm machine screws
## Spoil board
* Make sure the torsion box wood glue has dried enough to remove the clamping screws.
* Remove all the 5x50mm screws from the top of the torsion box.
* Find the four Ø6mm plug holes where the corners of the spoil board will go and put wooden dowels in the holes. 
* Apply glue to the bottom of the spoilboard
* Place the spoilboard on the wooden dowels
* Screw down the spoilboard using 28 of Ø4x40mm wood screws
* Remove the 28 Ø4x40mm wood screws when the glue has set.
