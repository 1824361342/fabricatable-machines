Arduino shield with connectors and shielding
Drill z for endstop upwards




## Observations and lessons learned

Vaccum hose upper guide bracket, better way of attaching?
Way of adding z up/down endstops? (Up breaks homeing cable
Use software travel limits to keep it from attempthing dump code

Missing a 12mm y rib for the torsion box, had the wrong name, is missed in cutsheet

Build thin box firsr, flip and glue. Leg screws hits ribs

Feet were missing the "pre-drill" milled slots

Missing 12mm box piece

Larger clearance holes for misaligned drilling

More drills, skip combo tool pga break

Tool for conical screws

Bit for both type of wood screw

Ingrease step on sides of spoilboard so it can take shipping abuse

Screws unde gantry collides x z carriage

Too long conical crashes with sole upper

Holddown screws in feet confusing where to screw 

Missed slots in 12mm legs

Countersink screws into the feet so that they can be left in. When added to table

Some leg screws hit interior ribs, annoying and needs changing. 

Think about ways to make the feet more stable. Perhaps the screw should lock into the foot now it has play? 

Confusing with sometimes 2 washers sometimes 1

Gantry feet vertical needs 4 static, adjystable can’t fit.

X-rail hade onödigt tight fit. Antingen bätte tol, remove them eller minst pre-break edges. En hade overtight fit.

Hard to see which side is up and down on some pics, especially top/bottom of gantry

Hour log:
Relaxed building of torsion box and legs:
3h with pizza break. Including lots of drilling and prep of rollers.

3 h more = completet drilling and threading. Assembled gantry and carriage and mounted them. 

remove wings på vertical y axis roller holder to avoid crash with other rollers (optional improvement, might interfear with covers)

Change tabs on  vertical y axis roller holder to make it impossible to assemble the wrong way


tightening order for X-rail, add more tolerance to the finger holes and break the tips

add Access to bottom gantry screws through the gantry feet 

Done:
Y motor plate wheels after vertical holder or collision happens. Also make them non identical to reduce mixup
