## Notes from assembly

Missade delar:
Bits till skruv
Varchro shields (dust covers)
Z homeing plate (alu) 
Spring holder brackets (alu)
Dust skirt bracket (alu)
Pinions (POM)
Dust skirt duct, (magnets, PLA and valcro)
Viper (cloth)
Arduino shield with connectors and shielding
Drill z for endstop upwards

## Observations and lessons learned

Vaccum hose upper guide bracket, better way of attaching?
Way of adding z up/down endstops? (Up breaks homeing cable
Use software travel limits to keep it from attempthing dump code

Build thin box firsr, flip and glue. Leg screws hits ribs

Larger clearance holes for misaligned drilling (alu)

More drills, skip combo tool pga break

Tool for conical screws

Bit for both type of wood screw

Ingrease step on sides of spoilboard so it can take shipping abuse

Screws unde gantry collides x z carriage

Too long conical crashes with sole upper

Confusing with sometimes 2 washers sometimes 1

Standardize wheel pattern. 
* 4 static on top y, 4 adjust bottom
* 4 adjustable in plane y
* X static top, adjbelow.
* x 3 static in the back, 4 adj on front
* Z static on the right, adj on the left
* Static in the back adj on the front (under the same valc cover)

Gantry feet vertical needs 4 static, adjystable can’t fit.

Hard to see which side is up and down on some pics, especially top/bottom of gantry

Hour log:
Relaxed building of torsion box and legs:
3h with pizza break. Including lots of drilling and prep of rollers.

3 h more = completet drilling and threading. Assembled gantry and carriage and mounted them. 

**?** remove wings på vertical y axis roller holder to avoid crash with other rollers (optional improvement, might interfear with covers)


tightening order for X-rail, add more tolerance to the finger holes and break the tips

Assemble Y motor plate wheels after vertical holder or collision happens. Also make them non identical to reduce mixup

Increase holes for long screws or buy shorter for the y wheels that clashed

## Done:
* Missing a 12mm y rib for the torsion box, had the wrong name, is missed in cutsheet (fixed)
* Feet were missing the "pre-drill" milled slots (fixed)
* Missing 12mm box piece (fixed)
* Think about ways to make the feet more stable. Perhaps the screw should lock into the foot now it has play? 
* Some leg screws hit interior ribs, annoying and needs changing. 
* add Access to bottom gantry screws through the gantry feet 

# TODO: 

## Design

### Alu cad
* Sensible holes in z stage for adapter
* Make adapter plate for new spindle (when I have verified hole pattern?)
* Change tabs on  vertical y axis roller holder to make it impossible to assemble the wrong way (or remove difficulty)
* Make the rollers not roll on the edges of the countersink on x.
* Test fit track rollers in CAD!

### Valchro CAD:
* New VFD pad for new VFD
* Bad fit valchro shields. Needs redesign (or verfication) +Make valchro sheilds sturdier?
* Holddown screws in feet confusing where to screw move to side!

### 3D-prints
* Different diameter adapter for hose
* 

## Mill 
* POM pinions

### Mill alu
* 6mm (Larger) clearance holes for misaligned drilling (alu) **CHECK!**
* X-rail hade onödigt tight fit. Antingen bätte tol, remove them eller minst pre-break edges. En hade overtight fit.

### Mill Valchro
* Countersink screws into the feet so that they can be left in. When added to table
* Also move the leg holddowns that look like screw holes
* Add parts that are on the list on the wood parts page

## Source
* Viper cloth
* Bits for all screws, conical and 
* M8 Nuts for top of adjustable feet
