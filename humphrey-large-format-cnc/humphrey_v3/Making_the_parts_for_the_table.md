# Torsion box table

_"A torsion box consists of two thin layers of material (skins) on either side of a lightweight core, usually a grid of beams."_

[Torsion boxes on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torsion_box)

The purpose of the tosion box is to make a stiff bed for the CNC machine to travel and operate on while keeping the parts easy to transport.

# Making the parts for the table

Materials required

Valchromat sheets 1220X2440 mm

* 1 of 19 mm 
* 3 of 8 mm 
* 3 of 12 mm

Equipment required

* CNC milling machine
* Holddown screws 
* 6 mm milling bits
* 3 mm milling bits

## Files
All you need to make the parts:
* [Cleaned DXF files from Rhino with optional holddown](Table_parts_DXF-cleaned_holddown.zip) Try these first.
* (Option) [DXF-files from fusion](Table_parts_DXF_from_fusion.zip) Try these if your CAM software can't open the ones above.

*Source files:* (Normally not needed)
* [Fusion model with layouts and most parts](https://a360.co/2Mzsrp2)
* [Fusion model with the main torsion box core parts](https://a360.co/2OGe8wh)
* [Fusion model with the legs](https://a360.co/2MuRitT)

* [Online 3D model containing all parts](https://a360.co/2AF6yjp)

## General

* The parts are modelled with dogbones for a 6mm bit.
* Additonal holddown screw-holes can and should be be added, also inside parts where needed.

## 12 mm sheets

3 sheets

The 3mm wide slots are 9 mm deep

* Sheet 1: 12 mm torsion box parts 1 
* Sheet 2: 12 mm torsion box parts 2 
* Sheet 3: 6 legs probe and VFD stiffeners 

## 8 mm sheets

3 sheets

The 3mm wide slots are 6.5 mm deep

The pockets on the top edges is 4mm deep in both cases.

* Sheet 1: 8 mm torsion box parts 1 (missing dogbbones)
* Sheet 2: 8 mm torsion box parts 2 
* Sheet 3: 8 mm torsion box parts 3 

## 19 mm sheet

1 sheet

The pockets on both long edges are 8.5mm deep.

* Sheet 1: 19 mm spoilboard with pre-drilled holes and ledges on the sides
