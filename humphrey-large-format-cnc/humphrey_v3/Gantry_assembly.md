## Threading the parts

In order to assemble the gantry you will first need to drill and thread the sideways holes into the aluminium parts. 
Using a proper setup and good tools for the work makes it much easier and reduces risks of injuries or damages.

There are 150 holes in total on the whole machine that needs drilling and threading and one person can drill and thread 40 holes per hour if they work efficently.

* Always keep the bits lubricated (or it will break, trust me). Wd-40, vaseline, oil... anytyhing goes. Using a dipping cup speeds things up.
* Use a power drill and a sharp spiral fluted bit.
* Drill horizontally, in hip height.
* Clamp the piece to a secure table so well that you can guide and press the drill with both hands. (To litte pressure = takes forever and everything gets hotter) 
* You can save some time by using a combination drilling and threading bit, just make sure to lubricate both parts of the bit.
* Dry chips = not enough lubrication.
* Use safety googles, sharp aluminium chips come flying off the bit, especially when reversing out.
