## General assembly advice

* M5x16 mm screws with cylinder head are used for 95% of all parts. Use these if nothing else is stated. They use a 4 mm hex bit.
* Washers are rarely needed and may interfear with fitting of parts, don't add washers unless asked to.
* Using a power drill with a 4 mm hex bit can shorten the assembly time
* DO NOT USE LARGE TOOLS, if you use a big ratchet wrench with a bit insert you will most likely not feel when you have reached the correct torque. This is the reason why small screws and have smaller tools.

## Before assembly: Threading the parts

In order to assemble the gantry you will first need to drill and thread the M5 sideways holes into the aluminium parts. 
Using a proper setup and good tools for the work makes it much easier and reduces risks of injuries or damages.

There are 150 holes in total on the whole machine that needs drilling and threading and one person can drill and thread 40 holes per hour if they work efficently.

NOTE: If you are multiple people helping with the assembly, thread the parts as you go, starting with the ones needed for the first steps.

![Threading](https://github.com/fellesverkstedet/fabricatable-machines/raw/master/humphrey-large-format-cnc/humphrey_v3/img/assembly/threading_bit.jpg)

* Always keep the bits lubricated (or it will break, trust me). Wd-40, vaseline, oil... anytyhing goes. Using a dipping cup speeds things up.
* Use a power drill and a sharp spiral fluted bit.
* Drill horizontally, in hip height. (Vertical = no pushing power and hard to hold steady)
* Clamp the piece to a secure table so well that you can guide and press the drill with both hands. (To litte pressure = takes forever and everything gets hotter) 
* You can save some time by using a combination drilling and threading bit, just make sure to lubricate both parts of the bit.
* Dry chips = not enough lubrication.
* Use safety googles, sharp aluminium chips come flying off the bit, especially when reversing out.
* Double check parts for missed drill holes, some are impossible to access without dissassembly later. Which is inconvenient but completely possible.

# Gantry feet

* Find two sets of these parts

![gantry feet](./img/assembly/gantry_feet2.jpg)

* Make two mirrored copies of the gantry feet, like this.

![gantry feet](./img/assembly/gantry_feet.jpg)

* Screw then together using the default M5x16 screws.
# Bridge core

* Find these parts:

![Brige core](./img/assembly/bridge_core.JPG)

* Screw the feet to the bridge bottom.

![Brige core](./img/assembly/bridge_core2.JPG)

* Screw the ribs to the bottom.

![Brige core](./img/assembly/bridge_core3.JPG)

* Screw the top to the ribs and the gantry feet.

![Brige core](./img/assembly/bridge_core4.JPG)

* Make sure they are attached this way:

![Brige core](./img/assembly/bridge_core5_close.JPG)

# X-rail and backside

* Find these parts:

![X-rail and backside](./img/assembly/x-rail-backside.JPG)

* Mount the X-rail onto the gantry.

![X-rail and backside](./img/assembly/x-rail-backside2.JPG)

* Make sure that the rack teeth are pointing down (to aviod them collecting dust)

![X-rail and backside](./img/assembly/x-rail-backside_teeth_up.JPG)

* Screw on the backside, no need to use all screws yet, this needs to come off later when we are installing the wires later.

![X-rail and backside](./img/assembly/x-rail-backside3.JPG)

* Make sure to tighten all screws. Start with the X-rail. 

![X-rail and backside](./img/assembly/x-rail_first.JPG)

# Gantry feet soles

* Find two sets of these parts, we will assemble with slightly different bearing configurations.

![Sole parts](./img/assembly/sole_parts.JPG)

*Check for missed drilling in the ends, they easy to miss.*

* Find bearings and the *fixed* bearing cores. They are as default assembled without washers.

![Sole parts](./img/assembly/center_exploded.JPG)

![Center](./img/assembly/center.JPG)

* Find the bearings, large washers and the *excentric* bearing cores. Note that the excenters always should have two washers on top of the bearing and as default one washer below the excenter. 

![Sole parts](./img/assembly/excenter_exploded.JPG)

![Center](./img/assembly/excenter.JPG)

* NOTE: Immedietly tighten screws holding *fixed* bearings and leave the screws holding the *excenters* loose.

## The soles

* Mounting the bearings before screwing the parts together makes it MUCH easier.

*  Make two of these: (Shown with the bearings hidden for visibillity)

![Bearings](./img/assembly/sole_vertical1.JPG)

* Both should look like this when done:

![Bearings](./img/assembly/sole_vertical2.JPG)

* Mount both of them on the bottom layers like this

![Bearings](./img/assembly/motor_layer_vertical_before_side_cores_explode.JPG)

![Bearings](./img/assembly/motor_layer_vertical_before_side_cores.JPG)

* Add the side bearings: NOTE THE DOUBLE WASHERS BELOW THE SIDE BEARINGS!

![Bearings](./img/assembly/motor_layer_vertical_side_cores.jpg)

![Bearings](./img/assembly/motor_layer_vertical_side_cores_mirror.JPG)

* REMINDER: Tighten the screws holding *fixed* bearings and leave the screws holding the *excenters* loose.

* For both soles, screw on the other ribs to the bottom layers:

![Sole](./img/assembly/sole2.JPG) 

*  For both soles, screw on the top layer and tighten the screws:

![Sole](./img/assembly/sole.JPG) 

* Now you have made the two ganty feet soles

![Sole](./img/assembly/both_soles.JPG) 

# Attaching the gantry feet soles

* Screw the gantry soles to the gantry feet.

![Sole to feet](./img/assembly/assembly_soles_to_feet.JPG) 

![Sole to feet](./img/assembly/assembly_soles_to_feet2.JPG) 

* It takes 4 screws to attach each sole, use the access holes in the bottom to reach them.

![Sole to feet](./img/assembly/soles_access_holes_screws.jpg) 

## Test measurement

We want to make sure the feet are paralell within a 1mm, that is +/- 0,5 mm. Otherwise we might struggle to tune the bearings later.

* Check this measurement in the front and in the back.

![Check](./img/assembly/paralell.jpg) 

* If it looks good, tighten all screws. If not, try to adjust it first.

# Mounting the gantry on the table

* You should now be able to lift and ease the gantry onto the Y-rails. Be at least two people before attempting this. No force should be needed to roll the gantry in place.

![Check](./img/assembly/mount_gantry.jpg) 

## Setting endstops

IMPORTANT: Install the endstop screws immedietly so that there is now risk of the ganry falling off the rails and hurting anybody. If for some reason you can not install the endstops at once, don't leave the gantry on the rails.

* Put short M5 screws as endstops in all four corners.
