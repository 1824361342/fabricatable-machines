# Tuning the motion system

Humphrey has a three axis linear motion system, the axis are named X, Y and Z. These names are the same ones later used when communicating the machine. 

XYZ PIC


Each linear axis is guided by rollers that roll on a rail, the axis are driven by a pinion cog-wheel on a motor which drives against the rack teeth. 

NAMES PIC

In order for the machine to work well both the guiding parts and the driving parts of the machine needs to be tuned. We always tune the guides first, then the motors with the pinions.

# Aligning the Y-rails - Installation tuning

The Y-rails are the "train tracks" under the long sides of the machine. We first need to make sure that they are paralell to each other if we want to be able to tune them.

Having a long straight guide tool is very helpful for this step!

RETTHOLT PIC

The Y-rails are each split in two pieces that are joined in the middle. They are fixed where they meet in the middle of the machine but the rest of them can be adjusted sideways.

_There are Ø6mm holes drilled through the aluminium Y-rails upp through the two 12mm valchromat layers. They are there to give a good starting position. They are mentioned in the Table assembly chapter so these instructions assume that you have used them already._

* Use the straight guide to check if the Y-rail on the side with the ledge is straight. If it isn't release screws and adjust as neccessary.

One side is now straight and will be our reference for the second one. 

* Find two M6 screws (any length) or Ø6mm wooden dowels. We will used them to create temporarily "stoppers" to set the gantry perpendicular to the rails while we tune them. 

* Insert the Ø6mm stopper screws or dowels into both sides of aluminum Y-rails to form stopping referenses for the gantry. Put them in the Ø6mm holes that are closest to the middle of the machine, and behind the gantry. They don't have to go in further than the aluminium, we just want them to stop the gantry from rolling past.

* Now we know that the gantry is "square" to the rails. Now we will set the rollers of the gantry feet to the width between the Y-rails. We do it here in the middle of the machine since the rails are at a fixed distance here.

## Tuning rollers

* To tune the rollers you will need a 8mm (steel) and a 17 mm wrench (it's part of the aluminium milling cut-sheets so you should have one).

![tools for tuning](https://github.com/fellesverkstedet/fabricatable-machines/raw/master/humphrey-large-format-cnc/humphrey_v3/img/assembly/tools.jpg)

* Not all rollers can or should be tuned. The ones you need to tune have an aluminum 6-side "nut" shape under the bearing and a hex-head bolt. The fixed rollers have a countersunk internal hex head and a round spacer, they should be nice and tight and will always be the fixed references we tune towards.

![rollers](https://github.com/fellesverkstedet/fabricatable-machines/blob/master/humphrey-large-format-cnc/humphrey_v3/img/assembly/fixed_moving.JPG)

* Always tighten the excenters in the counter-clockwise direction, this way it will not move when the bolt is tighened. (The adjustable rollers cosist of an exceter with 1,5mm travel in each direction when turned a full turn. This means that it can be tighened either direction, clockwise or counter-clockwise.)

TIGHTEN DIR PIC

* Check the tightness by spinning the bearing with your finger. MAKE SURE that you still can spin the bearing in place without rolling it along the rail. If you can't, it means that you have overtighened it, and you can't know by how much.

SPIN BEARING PIC

* Tighten them in this order, always make sure that the gantry is perpendicular to the table by pushing it aginst the stopper screws.
