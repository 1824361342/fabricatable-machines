# Making the aluminium parts

These parts are milled from 200x8mm flat bar aluminium 6082-T6 grade. We buy them from [Astrup AS](https://astrup.no/).

Total needed aluminium stock is five 3 m long pieces, but we strongly recommend buying an extra piece, then the total is 18 meters of 200x8mm aluminum flat bar, cut into six 3 m long pieces. 

The CNC we used for manufacturing has a 2440 mm long work area, show here in relation to the CAM layout for all parts:

Practically the work will be split up into one piece per session since they take many hours per stock.

## Notes from milling Humphrey v3
Some parts were missing in the layout: 
* Homing plate. (Now added)
* The small spindle spring mounting clamps.
* Dust skirt holder. 
* Two motor plate spacers. (Now added)

*TODO:* They need to be added!

Recommended changes:
* When milling. Make sure there is a loose fit tolerance between the X-rail and the gantry, otherwise it's hard to fit it on and impossible to change it.
