# Making the aluminium parts

These parts are milled from 200x8mm flat bar aluminium 6082-T6 grade. We buy them in 6 m lengths and cut them in half before milling.

The CNC we used for manufacturing has a 2440 mm long work area.

## Notes from milling Humphrey v3
Some parts were missing in the layout: 
* Homing plate.
* The small spindle spring mounting clamps.
* Dust skirt holder.
* Two motor plate spacers.

Recommended changes:
* When milling. Make sure there is a loose fit tolerance between the X-rail and the gantry, otherwise it's hard to fit it on and impossible to change it.
