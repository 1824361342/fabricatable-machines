 Make at least 4 of these and a few spares.
 
 Use 11-13 mm thick POM plastic sheet.

# 3D prints for Humphrey 4

These are all the 3D prints needed for dust protection of Humphreys rollers. 

## Instructions

It takes in total ca 30h to print all parts.

You need a 3D printer and some patience, any FDM-3d-printer will do. PETG and PLA seems to work fine.

Start with printing a copy of the cover "test platform" (see filename) and a "Roller_cover" to see if they fit.

Download the zip-files, unzip. Print the 33 parts in the quantities listed below, the quantiy is also written in each filename.

### Print settings

I recommend PLA or PETG with double or triple wall thickness using a 0.4mm nozzle and 20% infill but feel free to experiment with other settings. If you want to modify the parts, you can fish out the originals from the [assembly files here](https://a360.co/2NBCXcX).
