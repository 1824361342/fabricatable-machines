# Cost breakdown for building a Humphrey

These are the costs for all the raw materials like aluminum bars, all hardware like the motors and spindle and small things like glue, safety googles and all fasteners. This include everything needed to make and operate the machine, except the machines to make the parts on. All prices include shipping (to Oslo).

### Left in stock / Spare

Fasteners are bought by the box and aluminium stock in 6 m lengths, this means that there will be some parts left over after the project is delivered. That is provided that no extra aluminium was used up as spare to cover from milling mistakes etc. This is a representation of the values that will be left in stock and can be used in the next project.  

Note that this category does NOT include the tools that is "bound" to the machine, like wrenches for changing bits or safety glasses. Those are considered "consumed" by the building of the machine since they should not be removed from the machine.
