# How to make a kit of parts for Humphrey

![All parts to build the machine](img/all_parts_before_assembly.jpg)

*All parts of Humphrey v4 before assembly*

This is a guide on how to make kit of parts for the Humphrey CNC millling machine.

## Files

* [Fusion360 assembly](https://a360.co/2AF6yjp)
* [STEP assembly](https://github.com/fellesverkstedet/fabricatable-machines/raw/master/humphrey-large-format-cnc/humphrey_v3/Assembly_h3%20v5_step.zip)

## Costs of all raw materials and components

These are all the raw materials like aluminum bars, all hardware like the motors and spindle and small things like glue, safety googles and all fasteners. This include everything needed to make and operate the machine, except the machines to make the parts on. All prices include shipping (to Oslo).

#### Spreadsheet with all costs and supplier links

Copy this spreadsheet and use it purchase all the parts and raw materials listed. We have included links to online stores and product numbers for most parts.

## Making the parts

To make these parts you need the raw materials listed in the spreadsheets above.

The machining of the parts has been broken down into sub sections:

* [Milling the valchromat parts](Making_the_parts_for_the_table.md)
* [Milling the aluminium parts](alu_parts.md) 
* [Making the plastic parts](plastic_parts.md)
* [Leather skirt DXF file](laser_leather_skirt.dxf) for lasercutting
* [Making a shielded circuit board with connectors](https://github.com/fellesverkstedet/fabricatable-machines/blob/master/hrbl-shield/README.md)

### Production times for a solo experienced person
* Milling the aluminium parts took 5 regular workdays, CAM in Fusion360 and milled on a Shopbot
* Milling the valchromat parts took 1 regular workday, CAM in Rhino using [Bark Beetle](https://github.com/fellesverkstedet/Bark-beetle-parametric-toolpaths) on a Shopbot
* (Estimated from Cura) 20 h to print the 3D prints using one Ultimaker
