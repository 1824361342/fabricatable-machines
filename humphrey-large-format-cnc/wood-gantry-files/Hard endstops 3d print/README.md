3d printed designes should be adjusted to fit. Maybe 5% bigger? Test print and see. Direct print will probably be too tight.  
  
Be aware of print orientation for maximum strength: place part so tight fit doesnt break the part, and also layers 90deg (normal) on how it will be crashed against.
  
Designed for small wood screws 2mm diameter of screw core.  
Length according to material: ~16mm
Countersunk screw head.  
  
v1_hard_endstop_Y.stl: badly placed screw holes  
v2_hard_endstop_Y.stl: chamfer between square and pointy thing hits the divider. Needs to be a little smaller, but can be sanded/filed to fit.  
x_hard_endstop.stl: Seems ok, but should be bigger for a fit.
