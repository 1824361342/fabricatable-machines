### Status

*No longer developed, not reccomend for reproduction. See [Humphrey](https://github.com/fellesverkstedet/fabricatable-machines/blob/master/humphrey-large-format-cnc/README.md) for current reccomended large format machine*

Hobo is a large format cnc milling machine made from 12mm wood plates. It was demoed at FAB14 and is now part of Francisco Sanchez mobile fab lab.

### Design wins

* Super fast to CNC mill all the parts
* Very chaep to build
* The wood construction became very rigid
* Plastic rack gave decent performance
* Registering plastic rack with wooden dowels worked great
* Joining multiple rack pieces worked great *(this made it possible to milled all the rack pieces from a single 800mm x 400mm sheet of plastic)*
* Inline skatewheels roll very smooth on plain wood v-groves
* The two-sided mounting of the wheels doubling as wheel cover worked great
* Shipping only the gantry + y beams and then fab the rest of the bed from local wood sheets worked great and is a promising way of spreading large fromat Fab 2.0 machines

### Design fails

* The rubber inline rubber skatewheels made for a very soft and unstable milling machine. Large rubber wheels are too soft to make a decent CNC mill
* Having only tree inline skate wheels on the X axis instead of four made the machine even less stable
* Fine tuning the position of the wheels where difficult
* Combining the mounting of the Y  otors with the upper Y wheels made it very difficult to tune with high pressure on the wheel and low pressure on the pinion
