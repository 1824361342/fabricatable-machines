HECTOR was initially a 2017 fab academy final project. 

[Here is the full fab academy documentation.](http://archive.fabacademy.org/archives/2017/fablabverket/students/100/web/projects/diy_cnc/index.html)

In 2018 it got an upgrade with [nema24 integrated closed loop stepper motors](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/NEMA24-3Nm-425oz-in-Integrated-Closed-Loop-Stepper-motor-with-driver-36VDC-JMC-iHSS60-36-30/32822797339.html) which made it more reliable and simplified its electonics.
