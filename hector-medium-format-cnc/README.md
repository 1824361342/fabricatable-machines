## About ##

#### 2017
HECTOR was initially a 2017 fab academy final project. [Here is the full fab academy documentation.](http://archive.fabacademy.org/archives/2017/fablabverket/students/100/web/projects/diy_cnc/index.html)

#### 2018
In 2018 it got an upgrade with [JMC iHSS60 nema24 integrated closed loop stepper motors](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/NEMA24-3Nm-425oz-in-Integrated-Closed-Loop-Stepper-motor-with-driver-36VDC-JMC-iHSS60-36-30/32822797339.html) which made it more reliable and simplified its electonics.

#### 2019
Hector got upgraded with HRBL-shield a [board house PCB](https://github.com/fellesverkstedet/fabricatable-machines/tree/master/hrbl-shield#hrbl---grbl-shield-for-integrated-motors) for Arduino Nano + grbl

### Coming upgrades

* Indctive homing sensors, (needs sensor mounts, 3d print)
* Lighter spindle, based om BLDC motor = removes the need for a bulky VFD
* Power brick power supply, (should be dimensioned by measuing current draw)
* 3D printed covers for all electronics
* Probe procedure, can probe on frame? (wire signal, possibly better with isolated probe plate due to noise)
* Mounting system, wall hanging? 
* Stock mounting method for PCB milling
* Dust management system for 800W spindle.
* Emergency stop. (Spring for spindle?)

## Files ##

In this folder you will find .f3d fusion360 files, .step files and .pdf and eagle .sch schematics of the simple cable harness.

## Performance ##

HECTOR has mostly been used as a "show-bot" but "finger based low load backlash testing" (instruction to be written) indicated that the precision is +/- 0.2 mm on the X axis and +/- 0.05 on the Y axis (the longer one with two motors). The reason for the higher performance in Y direction is belived to be because of the higher friction generated by the weight resting on the chamfer of the X axis, on the Y axis the load is supported on the flat side of the chamfer.

## Recommended upgrade ## 

For an even higher precision in X-direction and easier machining, consider removing the chamfer on the edge of the rails and develop "square glide blocks". This is not yet tested but we have high hopes for high performance on medium load. For high load, please consider the roller-axis solution instead.

See rectangle-rail files here:
