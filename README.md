# Simple gantry

A linear actuator designed to be fabricated in a Fablab, to the desired length/resolution/size.
It can be used to build custom digital fabrication machines, from laserengraving to light-duty milling.
Initial prototype is for a gantry-based vinyl/laser-cutter.

## Status

**Prototyping in progress**


## TODO

Basics

* Come up with a better name. birdbeak? V?
* Upload pictures/results of initial tests to Github repo

Full-machine test

* Design & Fabricate Y axis
* Fabricate 2 X axis
* Test using 12mm PolyEthylene
* Make a Z-carriage
* Attach a laser diode, run tests

FAB12 workshop

* Create a manufacturing plan (which parts when)
* Create a workshop plan (scope, participant involvment)
* Polish documentation in Github repo
* Do it!

Bonus

* Research coupling with
