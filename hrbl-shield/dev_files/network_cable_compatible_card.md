# HRBL shield development idea - Network cable for signal

Features

* 8P8C sockets for the 4 motors (network cable connectors)
* ICs with 4 optocouplers each for the galvanics isolation
* Components that can be monted by factory

Other improvements
* Double check if linear power regulator is still reasonable. Switched?
* Separate area on the PCB for the power distribution. Add spare connectors for ligths etc.
* Possibly a network cable adapter for the motor side

Notes:
DNS means do not stuff in PCBway BOM language.
