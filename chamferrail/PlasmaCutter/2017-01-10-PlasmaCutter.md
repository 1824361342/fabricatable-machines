Ideas for making a Plasma cutter CNC
====================================

What is this:
-------------
We want to make a Handi-bot style plasma cutter CNC that can be moved by hand and placed on the plate to be cut.
**Advantages:**
- It can be moved to the material.
- Does not need a dedicated cutting table
- Can be stored easily, like hung on the wall
- It can be taken with you out of the shop
- It can cut larger objects than itself by doing partial cuts

**Feature ideas:**
- Use magnets to attach it to steel plates
