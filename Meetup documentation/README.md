Attending:  
Short description: First time at OsloMet makerspace, where Haakon Walsengs Wooden Humphrey is now placed. Presentation of the attending, short about the Fabricatable Machines project. Tour of the makerspace, and some practical work: mounting 3 3d printed hard endstops (2x Y in back, green, and X on left side). First test milling on this machine. Information about the machine, and a proposal of how we can check milled parts for accuracy compared to the ideal design file (hint: flatbed scanning with high DPI).
