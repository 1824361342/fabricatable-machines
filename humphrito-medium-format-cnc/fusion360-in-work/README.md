**Status:**

This is my design files for Humphrito, parametrically designed in Fusion360. It will be milled shortly. These files are in work and are incomplete.

*Notes:*

Had to change some thicknesses to fit the parts on 2 pieces of stock valchromat, still some tuning to make that nice

*Missing:*
* Holes for easy glueing of spoilboard
* 8mm X and Z axis platescarriage (perhaps not enought material)
* 8mm All Motor plates, sketches exist
* All POM pieces (glide blocks and pinions) Sketches exists
* CAM
