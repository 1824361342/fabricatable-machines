**Status:**

This is my design files for Humphrito, parametrically designed in Fusion360. It will be milled shortly. These files are in work and are incomplete.

*Notes:*

Had to change some thicknesses to fit the parts on 2 pieces of stock valchromat, still some tuning to make that nice

*Must be fixed:*
* Holes for easy glueing of spoilboard
* Fingers for aligning the tosion box to the y-axis and backing
* 8mm X and Z axis plates
* 8mm All Motor plates, sketches exist
* 8mm z-axis rail, spacer and backing   ((perhaps not enought 8mm material)
* Add perforation and guide for changing to alu later
* Add rack teeth (will lag so I do this last)
* All POM pieces (glide blocks and pinions) Sketches exists
* CAM

*Before milling*
* Test screw slot grip
* Tune dimensions for nut sizes and for screw lengths

*Check*
* Issues - enhancements
* Can the Y range be increased so that we have acces to the work area above the gantry in resting position
