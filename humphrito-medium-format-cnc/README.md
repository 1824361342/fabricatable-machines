# Humphrito Medium format CNC 

A medium sized gantry based CNC machine made to be able to machine an area the size of a quarter of a standard 1200x2500mm plate.

See also (Humphrey)[/humphrey-large-format-cnc/README.md] for a full size machine.

## Status:

**Update:** [Joinery experiment](experiment.md)


In development. Design files in Fusion360, step and Rhino format.

The Fusion 360 files are further progressed and will be completed and milled shortly. 

### Notes on the Fusion model:
*Must be fixed:*
* Holes for easy glueing of spoilboard
* Fingers for aligning the tosion box to the y-axis and backing
* 8mm X and Z axis plates
* 8mm All Motor plates, sketches exist
* 8mm z-axis rail, spacer and backing   ((perhaps not enought 8mm material)
* Add perforation and guide for changing to alu later
* Add rack teeth (will lag so I do this last)
* All POM pieces (glide blocks and pinions) Sketches exists
* CAM

*Before milling*
* Test screw slot grip
* Tune dimensions for nut sizes and for screw lengths

*Check*
* Issues - enhancements
* Can the Y range be increased so that we have acces to the work area above the gantry in resting position
