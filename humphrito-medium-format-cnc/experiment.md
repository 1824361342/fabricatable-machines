## Valchromat finger joint and scews

I tried various configurations of screwing valchromat pieces together without predrilling, instead using a 3-axis mill and a 3 mm endmill for slotting tracks for the screw to run in.

### Results

I found a few interesting things. My favourite configuration was a 5 mm diameter wood screw, 3 mm "core" diameter, 50 mm long with an unthreaded neck.
This gave the absolutely highest torque before the threads fail. The unthreaded neck helps lots in not splitting the valchromat from the top.
The "core" fits prefectly in the 3mm milled slot and gives maximum pressure on the threads without uncessecary friction. The depth of the slot needs to be a little more than 5mm. More would be beneficial but weakens the valchromat in general then.
The length of the slot should be longer than the screw to avoid uncecessary splitting forces. The predrilled hole should be a tight clearance hole for the thread to align the screw. It should be positioned so that the screw thread does not press into the bottom of the slot (would just generate splitting force).

The failure is always that the valchromat splits and then the thread is dug away. Stopping the splitting is key. 

Another interesting thing to note is that the valchromat will always split on the same side due to the forces from turning the screw. this means that this method can be used with a single finger.
The finger on one side helps prevent early splitting! Use it.

I also tried an "extreme" mode with the slot in the finger itself, it seemed to work well as well but needs more testing if the head needs a washer for it to work well.
