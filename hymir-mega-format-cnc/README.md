* A modular fabiraction system for building size fabriaction
* Designed for super fast fabriaction using standard size MDF, HDF or plywood plates
* Aiming at medium to low accuarcy and rigidity
* Aliming at very low material and prduction cost
* There is also potential for a high performache version using steel plates and welding. Proof of principle test milling racks for this [here.](https://youtu.be/Pyblj0Z6MnE)
* Linear rails, rack and pinion can all be fabricated on a conventional CNC milling machine
* Inline skate wheels could be used for linear bearings
* Large rack and pinion makes fast fabriaction in both wood and steel
* Large teeth allow for more misalignment of modualar axes.
* Large teeth also allow for higher performce in weaker materials *(an 11mm wide tooth from 18mm MDF is quite strong)*
* We are currently exploring direct extrusion 3D printing, CNC milling and pick and place fabrication.
* Named after the giant [Hymir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hymir) of Norse mythology
