Work in progress on combining multiple Fabricatable Axes to facilitate a fabrication workflow consisting of multiple different workflows. Utlimately we want to use the fabricatable axis to extract precission from CAD into multiple simple workshop interactions. So far this includes: 

- cutting
- drilling 
- mounting
